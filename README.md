# 4-bit-binary-counter
**Types of Counters:**
There are two main types of 4-bit binary counters:
Asynchronous Counter (Ripple Counter)
Synchronous Counter
**Asynchronous 4-bit Counter (Ripple Counter)**
Clock is given only to the first flip-flop.
Each flip-flop toggles on the falling edge of the previous one.
Slower due to propagation delays.
**Synchronous 4-bit Counter**
All flip-flops receive the clock simultaneously.
Faster and preferred in high-speed applications.
**Applications**
Frequency division
Digital clocks
Event counters
Memory address generation
Timers
